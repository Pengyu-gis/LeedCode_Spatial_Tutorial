'''
When we were analyzing the problem, we came across the following equation
c = a + b

but can we write the above equation as -
b = c - a

we can iterate through the array only once and calculate the difference of target (c) and the current element (a) and find the other element (b).

# Approach 2
from typing import List

def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    # List to store results
    result = []
    # Dictionary to store the difference and its index
    index_map = {}
    # Loop for each element
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        # Difference which needs to be checked
        difference = target - n
        if difference in index_map:
            result.append(i)
            result.append(index_map[difference])
            break
